# Logs

## What I Track

Each daily log includes three main sections:

### Habits

Binary tracking `yes/no` for habit goals completion

### Work

High-level progress updates on main work/projects, occasionally going into technical details when needed

### Side Quests

Personal projects, learning activities, and exploratory work

## Why?

These logs serve as a daily reflection and tracking system, documenting progress across habits, work, and personal projects because I want to do it.
