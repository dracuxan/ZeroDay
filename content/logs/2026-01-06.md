# Day 1

## Habits

- [x] Logs
- [ ] 5k Steps
- [x] Research Paper
- [ ] Side Project
- [x] Book Reading

Notes on habits today:

Was too busy with work today, got no time to walk much so couldn't even complete the minimum steps. Started with daily logs from today, let's see how this goes (or how long). Still stuck with recursion paper `Making Sense of Recursion Patterns` - done with basic folding methods but paramorphism is proving a bit difficult to implement. Will see how to solve that very soon. Skipped working on side project for today.

## Work

Had a lot of client changes today. Done with the final draft - let's just hope there are not any more.

## Side Quests

Explored headless CMS today, specifically [[https://strapi.io|Strapi]]. It's really cool and easy to integrate with Next.js. Tried integrating it with my old portfolio [[https://zero-day-experiment.vercel.app/blogs/strapi|see the implementation here]] and it turned out to be pretty simple than I thought, though it still took a lot of time.

Here's how I did it:

Since I already had my website, the frontend part was simple enough. Just needed to fetch data from Strapi's API endpoints and map them to my Next.js components. The main challenge was the integration and hosting the CMS backend, but that turned out to be simple as well - you can deploy using Strapi's cloud services which is free up to a certain number of requests. Then just generate an API token, add it to Vercel variable management, and done.

## TLDR

- Started daily logs - let's see how long this lasts
- Work kept me busy, missed step goal but completed other habits
- Integrated Strapi CMS with my portfolio - easier than expected
- Still struggling with paramorphism in recursion paper

Peace out.
