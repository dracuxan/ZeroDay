# Day 2

## Habits

- [x] Logs
- [ ] 5k Steps
- [x] Research Paper
- [x] Side Project
- [ ] Book Reading

Notes on habits today:

yet another day where i did not walk much. fuck. anyways, progress on research paper is not looking good either.
can't make sense of how to implement [paramorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramorphism) rn cuz it has operations like operation on tail of tail,
so it's kinda an elaborated fold right method, but the use cases are so low for it and forcefully making some kind of implementation seems dumb.
like u would not do a palindrome check with it when the tail is gonna be unused anyways.
well, as soon as i find a real use case, i'm moving on. like it doesn't make sense to waste time like this.
btw, i'm reading [`The Fall of The Human Intellect`](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/827erta.The_Fall_of_the_Human_Intellect) rn (re-reading it).
it's a good one for reminders about things u already know.

## Work

since i started work at second company officially, the first day isn't as hectic as i thought it would be, rather it feels a bit slow (still waiting for my pr to be merged).
worked on that cms integration for the official website.
let's hope it doesn't blow up when it goes live.

## Side Quests

watched [Chainsawman](https://myanimelist.net/anime/44511/Chainsaw_Man) today. i have no idea why i did not watch it before this. that anime is a masterpiece (i exaggerate). other than that, just checked out [`Phoenix`](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) framework for [`Elixir`](https://elixir-lang.org/) and riced my wsl setup a bit cuz some of the work software doesn't work properly on my nixos setup. sigh.

## TLDR

- skipped walking again - need to fix this habit
- still stuck on paramorphism, looking for a real use case before moving on
- first official day at second company was chill, shipped cms integration
- watched Chainsawman - no idea why i didn't watch it before
- checked out Phoenix framework for Elixir, riced wsl setup

peace out.
