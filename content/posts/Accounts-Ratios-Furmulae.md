## **A. Ratios from the Balance Sheet Question**

1. **Current Ratio**  
   \[
   \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
   \]

2. **Quick (Acid-Test) Ratio**  
   \[
   \text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Quick Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
   \]  
   where  
   \[
   \text{Quick Assets} = \text{Current Assets} - \text{Inventory (Stock)} - \text{Prepaid Expenses (if any)}
   \]

3. **Inventory to Working Capital Ratio**  
   \[
   \text{Inventory to Working Capital Ratio} = \frac{\text{Inventory}}{\text{Working Capital}}
   \]  
   and  
   \[
   \text{Working Capital} = \text{Current Assets} - \text{Current Liabilities}
   \]

4. **Debt to Equity Ratio**  
   \[
   \text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Long-term Debt (e.g., Debentures, Long-term Loans)}}{\text{Shareholders' Funds (Equity)}}
   \]

5. **Proprietary Ratio**  
   \[
   \text{Proprietary Ratio} = \frac{\text{Shareholders' Funds (Equity)}}{\text{Total Assets}}
   \]

6. **Capital Gearing Ratio**  
   \[
   \text{Capital Gearing Ratio} = \frac{\text{Fixed Interest-bearing Funds (e.g., Debentures, Preference Share Capital if it carries fixed dividend)}}{\text{Equity Shareholders' Funds}}
   \]

7. **Current Assets to Fixed Assets Ratio**  
   \[
   \text{Current Assets to Fixed Assets Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Fixed Assets}}
   \]

## **B. Ratios from the Profit and Loss Account Question**

1. **Gross Profit Ratio**  
   \[
   \text{Gross Profit Ratio} = \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Sales}} \times 100
   \]  
   where  
   \[
   \text{Gross Profit} = \text{Sales} - \text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}
   \]

2. **Net Profit Ratio**  
   \[
   \text{Net Profit Ratio} = \frac{\text{Net Profit}}{\text{Sales}} \times 100
   \]

3. **Operating Ratio**  
   \[
   \text{Operating Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cost of Goods Sold} + \text{Operating Expenses}}{\text{Sales}} \times 100
   \]  
   where  
   \[
   \text{Operating Expenses} = \text{Selling \& Distribution Expenses} + \text{Administrative Expenses} + \text{Finance Charges}, \text{ etc.}
   \]

4. **Cost Ratios (to Cost of Production)**

   - **(i) Materials Consumed Ratio**  
     \[
     \text{Materials Consumed Ratio} = \frac{\text{Materials Consumed}}{\text{Cost of Production}} \times 100
     \]  
     \[
     \text{Materials Consumed} = \text{Opening Stock of Materials} + \text{Purchases} - \text{Closing Stock of Materials}
     \]

   - **(ii) Labour Cost Ratio**  
     \[
     \text{Labour Cost Ratio} = \frac{\text{Direct Wages}}{\text{Cost of Production}} \times 100
     \]

   - **(iii) Production Overhead Cost Ratio**  
     \[
     \text{Production Overhead Cost Ratio} = \frac{\text{Manufacturing (Production) Expenses}}{\text{Cost of Production}} \times 100
     \]

### **Note on “Cost of Production” vs. “COGS”**

- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** often includes all direct manufacturing costs plus/minus changes in inventory of finished goods.
- **Cost of Production** is typically the cost incurred in producing the goods (often _before_ selling and distribution expenses).

Depending on the specific definitions and adjustments for opening/closing work in progress, finished goods, etc., these terms can differ slightly in practice.
