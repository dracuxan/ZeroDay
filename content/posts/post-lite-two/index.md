## Who Am I?

Yolo! I'm Nisarg!  
I’m a curious tech learner who loves building, breaking, and exploring. Over time, I’ve dived into reverse engineering, binary exploitation, Go projects, Linux tinkering, open-source contributions, and even a few startup ideas. If it involves **tech + problem-solving**, I’m in.

I learn fast, unlearn when needed, and I’m always experimenting. Whether it’s writing APIs in Go,
hacking on a distributed storage concept, or setting up dev environments with Nix.

## What is Zero-Day?

**Zero-Day** is my personal vault.  
It’s where I collect my projects, experiments, and thoughts. Everything from security research and side
projects to random explorations that might one day grow into something bigger. Think of it as my
workshop + journal.

The name comes from “zero-day” in security, but here it’s about **fresh starts, raw ideas, and unfiltered experiments**.

Stay tuned — I’ll keep sharing what I build, learn, and break along the way 🚀
