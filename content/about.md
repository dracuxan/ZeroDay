I’m a CS undergrad who loves building and breaking things. I’m an optimist who believes coding can solve just about anything.
You’ll usually find me coding, but when I’m not, I’m either reading a book, watching a movie, or playing Valorant.

I’m currently learning `C` and `Rust` and creating most of my projects in `Go`. I'm learning `Rust` using their official book - [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book).

I’m always eager to learn new things and open to collaboration. If you have any questions, suggestions, or potential work opportunities,
feel free to reach out to me at nisargkhodke@gmail.com.
